## Vision :

Empower Individuals – Enable students and professionals to own and control their verified credentials.

Eliminate Credential Fraud  – Use blockchain technology to prevent fake degrees and resumes.

Instant Verification  – Allow employers to verify qualifications securely and instantly using EDU Chain.

Decentralized & Transparent  – Remove dependency on centralized authorities for trustless credential validation.

Privacy-First Approach  – Implement Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for selective disclosure of credentials.

Seamless Integration  – Provide APIs for job portals, HR tools, and universities to connect with EduResume.

Cost-Effective & Scalable  – Reduce verification costs and scale globally using NFT-based credentialing.

Future-Proof Credentials  – Ensure credentials remain tamper-proof, portable, and universally recognized.
